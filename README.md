# CS230-Operating-Platforms
The Gaming Room is a new client that wants a web-based game that is available on multiple platforms. The client wanted us to design a software that could be ran on these different platforms and could have users play together on the different platforms. For this documentation, I believe I did particularly well researching and finding the best software to create this app on. What I liked best about working through this design document was that it outlined the contraints of the software and helped define the limitations and requirements. This ensures that the project is developed correctly and to the client's tastes. If I could choose one part of the document to revise, I would pick the summary of the chosen software at the very end. I would have gone into further detail as to why that software is the best choice for the client. We ensured user needs were considered when creating this software design. This is important as it helps the client to have a successful application that users will want to use and come back to. When designing this software, I used a research-heavy approach. While knowledge of the software is important, in the future I would take into account more of user interface and user needs, as well as looking into examples of similar software designs as well.
